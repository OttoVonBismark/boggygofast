Child models need Edit functionality at some point, but despite my best efforts, I can't seem to implement it without major bugs. We'll revisit this later, but for sake of

Make page templates for Games and include fancy SCSS. Plan with style overrides in mind depending on what page is being displayed. Use an uploader and style model?
See http://www.diatomenterprises.com/dynamically-compile-stylesheets-with-rails-and-sass/ for ideas.

INTEGRATION TESTS PART DEUX- Is the right CSS being used for the right games? Ori would be a good candidate for this.

Logic logic logic! Remember how Ruby does switches (that is to say, cases) and format db retrievals based on that. Use seeds to your advantage.

TESTS GALORE! Make sure if a user dies, their runs go with it, but NOT ALL RUNS FOR A GAME! That said, if a Game dies, all of it's runs die regardless of Users.
