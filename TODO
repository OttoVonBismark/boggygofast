Introduce Admin userlevel and functions
Create pages only Admins can see (The run validation queue, for example)

TEST RIGOROUSLY to make sure only Admins can do certain things, and users can't promote themselves (Admins are to be set in console... maybe) [Research topic]

Introduce the Games model/controller
TDD Time!
Make page templates for Games and include fancy SCSS. Plan with style overrides in mind depending on what page is being displayed.

INTEGRATION TESTS PART DEUX- Is the right CSS being used for the right games? Ori would be a good candidate for this.

Introduce the Speedruns model/controller
TDD Time! Make sure the right runs come up for the right games.
Logic logic logic! Remember how Ruby does switches (that is to say, cases) and format db retrievals based on that. Use seeds to your advantage.

TESTS GALORE! Make sure if a user dies, their runs go with it, but NOT ALL RUNS FOR A GAME! That said, if a Game dies, all of it's runs die regardless of Users.
