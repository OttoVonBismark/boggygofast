# Boggy Go Fast
## Speedrun Archive Application

Currently feature-incomplete, Boggy Go Fast is a speedrun archiving tool. The current aim is to get this thing out of alpha once all the components have at least basic implementation. Once that's done, said features will be refined until we're ready for LAN-mode release. Once that's done, I'll begin work on a separate branch for the internet-facing permutation which will feature much more stringent security. That said, do NOT run the LAN version on internet-facing servers. It has no account activation mechanisms, password resets, etc. by design since it is, as it's name would imply, designed for personal usage on a local network environment with no email server.

## Why even use this?

A good question! If you're a speedrunner, Boggy Go Fast can help you keep track of your times, as well as those of your friends. It's geared more towards casual runners who aren't overly interested in world-class speedrunner strats, preferring instead to 'freestyle' through games as fast as possible without feeling pressured by the more dedicated runners.
